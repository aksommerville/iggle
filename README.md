2025-02-28

Entry for [Code for a Cause](https://itch.io/jam/code-for-a-cause), theme "KEEP MOVING FORWARD".

Help the eagle put all the things in their place by flapping his wings with the space bar.

## Agenda

- Fri 2025-02-28
- - [x] Throwaway implementation to confirm the concept is tractable. ...CONFIRMED
- - [x] Global mode switch: game,hello,farewell
- - [x] Enough graphics to get started with. 32x32 tiles.
- - [x] Real sprites framework.
- - [x] Load maps.
- - [x] Flight, collisions, carrying. Everything we have in throwaway.
- - [x] Level termination.
- Sat 2025-03-01
- - [ ] When one pumpkin sits on another just by the toes, you land on the lower one and things go a little weird.
- - - I think the best bet would be when you pick up the pumpkin, force nearby sprites within Iggle's vertical range away.
- - [ ] Hazards.
- - [ ] Scorekeeping.
- - [ ] Proper graphics.
- - [ ] Hello and Farewell splashes.
- - [ ] Proper maps.
- - - Bonk-to-drop is not obvious. Ensure the first level or two have just one pumpkin, and then train the user on bonking.
- - - 3-row apertures are surprisingly difficult to pass through.
- - - 45-degree slopes, both ceiling and floor, are pretty annoying.
- Sun 2025-03-02
- - [ ] Press Start to reset level.
- - [ ] Music.
- - [ ] Sound effects.
- - [ ] Itch page.
- - [ ] Have an arguably complete game by EOD. I don't want to do a lot during the week.
- - [ ] Submit to jam? We can keep revising once submitted, I believe.

Stretch goals, whenever:
- [ ] Minicomic.
- [ ] Ridiculously excessive background graphics. Thinking, clouds moving and parting, trees blowing in the wind, lights going on and off in the distant city...
- [ ] Hand-drawn graphics for the foreground? Might look cool...
- [ ] Even if not hand-drawn, a rotating sprite for the wing would probly be a good touch.
