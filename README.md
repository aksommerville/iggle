Help the eagle put all the things in their place by flapping his wings with the space bar.

## Agenda

- Fri 2025-02-28
- - [x] Throwaway implementation to confirm the concept is tractable. ...CONFIRMED
- - [x] Global mode switch: game,hello,farewell
- - [x] Enough graphics to get started with. 32x32 tiles.
- - [x] Real sprites framework.
- - [x] Load maps.
- - [x] Flight, collisions, carrying. Everything we have in throwaway.
- - [x] Level termination.
- Sat 2025-03-01
- - [x] When one pumpkin sits on another just by the toes, you land on the lower one and things go a little weird.
- - - I think the best bet would be when you pick up the pumpkin, force nearby sprites within Iggle's vertical range away.
- - [x] Hazards. ...no hazards
- - [x] Scorekeeping.
- - [x] Proper graphics.
- - [x] Make grabbing a little more tolerant. Landing on a pumpkin without grabbing it should be rare.
- - [x] Allow certain pumpkin tiles to resist transform (the ones with text)
- - [x] Hello and Farewell splashes.
- - [x] We should allow pumpkins to stack on the goal. It's hard to avoid, and hard to explain why that's not "on goal".
- - [x] Cheat hero's hit box down at the top when flying, he hits the ceiling too soon. ...no reason to do it only while flying, much easier to shorten him always.
- - [x] Need a bigger font.
- - [ ] Proper maps.
- - - Bonk-to-drop is not obvious. Ensure the first level or two have just one pumpkin, and then train the user on bonking.
- - - 3-row apertures are surprisingly difficult to pass through.
- - - 45-degree slopes, both ceiling and floor, are pretty annoying.
- Sun 2025-03-02
- - [ ] Press Start to reset level.
- - [x] Music.
- - [ ] Sound effects.
- - [ ] Itch page.
- - [ ] Have an arguably complete game by EOD. I don't want to do a lot during the week.
- - [ ] Submit to jam? We can keep revising once submitted, I believe.
- Mon 2025-03-03
- Tue 2025-03-04
- Wed 2025-03-05
- Thu 2025-03-06

Stretch goals, whenever:
- [ ] Minicomic.
- [ ] Ridiculously excessive background graphics. Thinking, clouds moving and parting, trees blowing in the wind, lights going on and off in the distant city...
- [ ] Hand-drawn graphics for the foreground? Might look cool...
- [ ] Even if not hand-drawn, a rotating sprite for the wing would probly be a good touch.
