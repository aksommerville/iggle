Stretch goals, whenever:
- [ ] Minicomic.
- [ ] Ridiculously excessive background graphics. Thinking, clouds moving and parting, trees blowing in the wind, lights going on and off in the distant city...
- [ ] Hand-drawn graphics for the foreground? Might look cool...
- [ ] Even if not hand-drawn, a rotating sprite for the wing would probly be a good touch.
